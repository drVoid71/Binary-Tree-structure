# Binary-Tree-structure
C++ Project - Print binary tree structure - console application

A good learning tool when studying binary trees in Computer Science (or any major).

This application performs:
  1. In-Order printout (print binary tree elements in order; sorted).
  2. Pre-Order - Depth First Search
  3. Post-Order - Depth First Search
  4. Level-Order - Breadth First Search
  5. Prints out the binary tree structure (with nodes and arrows - lines / \ ).

Feel free to try it out :)
